## Clean Install
When buying a new Windows laptop, one of the first things I do is clean install to avoid the bloatware that is preloaded.

Download Windows 10/11 installation media
- [Windows 10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209)
- [Windows 11](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295)

To clean install you will need the following:
- An internet connection
- Sufficient data storage available on a computer, USB or external drive for the download.
- A blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB


Once downloaded, Open the application and follow the instructions to create the media. 

Once completed, start the installation process.

After a clean installation of Windows I like to ensure that the OS is updated completely before moving to the next section.

## Tools
I recommend the following tools to start any web or scripting project.
 
#### Applications
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MA13FJ) which is installed by default.
- [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)
- [Docker](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)


#### Languages
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Java](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Where can I learn to make apps?

There are plenty of resources available for free to learn how to build web applications. 

#### Web Applications
Learn the basics of web development with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

Do a few projects like mocking up your favorite website, then rebuild it in a way that you like it. If there is an open source project you like, contribute and work on your skills.

Follow up with your fundamentals with learning up-to-date frameworks like [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) or [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)

#### Scripts
Learn the basics of [python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) and decide on what you would like to use with it. 

[Artificial Intellegence (AI) and Machine Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) are very popular choices with python but you can also develop [automated script](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/) and [web apps](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

## Now what?
The sky is the limit!!  With the following information you now have a fresh install of windows with the proper tools and languages needed to build your next application.
